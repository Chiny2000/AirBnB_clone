AirBnB Clone Project

Introduction
Enoch Osei Agyekumhene and other team members have established the groundwork for a web application inspired by AirBnB in this project. Our objective is to develop a command-line interpreter responsible for handling AirBnB objects, setting the stage for subsequent development phases, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end design.
Project Overview

Initiating our project, we prioritized the creation of a command-line interpreter dedicated to managing AirBnB objects. This foundational step is pivotal, serving as the cornerstone for the upcoming phases of our project. Upon completing this stage, we successfully accomplished the following:

Create a foundational class named BaseModel, responsible for initializing objects, as well as handling serialization and deserialization processes.

Establish a seamless flow for serialization and deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.

Define and implement classes for various AirBnB objects (e.g., User, State, City, Place), all inheriting from the BaseModel class.

Introduce a file storage system, serving as the primary abstracted storage engine for the project.

Develop comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of our classes and storage engine.

Command Interpreter

At the core of our project lies the command interpreter, which mimics a simplified version of the Shell tailored to our specific requirements. Through the command interpreter, we were able to execute the following actions:

Create new objects, such as Users or Places.
Retrieve objects from files or databases.
Perform operations on objects, including counting and computing statistics.
Update attributes of existing objects.

Remove objects from the system.

Learning Objectives

By completing this project, we gained a deeper understanding of essential programming concepts and tools such as ;

Achievements and Learning Goals

Through the successful completion of this project, we have enhanced our comprehension of crucial programming concepts and tools, including:

Organizing and managing code through the creation of a Python package.
Crafting a command interpreter using Python's cmd module.
Applying unit testing practices in the context of a large-scale project.
Serializing and deserializing class instances for efficient storage and retrieval.
Writing and reading JSON files to facilitate data persistence.
Handling time-related tasks and generating unique identifiers using the datetime and UUID modules.
Implementing *args and **kwargs for flexible argument passing in functions.
Effectively managing named arguments in function definitions.

Copyright and Academic Integrity

As responsible learners and developers, it is imperative to maintain ethical standards. Therefore, the team diligently tackled the tasks independently, refraining from relying on readily available online solutions to ensure authenticity.

Project Tools

Python Scripts

Editors: vi, vim, emacs.

The code was interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5).

All modules conclude with a new line.

The first line of each module is #!/usr/bin/python3.

A README.md file is present at the root of the project folder.

All code adheres to pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) guidelines.

Modules are executable.

Comprehensive documentation is provided for modules, classes, and functions. This documentation elucidates the purpose and functionality of each module, class, or method

Conclusion

Initiating this project has empowered the team with a deep understanding of the command interpreter, equipping us with valuable skills that will lay a robust foundation for the subsequent stages of our web application development
